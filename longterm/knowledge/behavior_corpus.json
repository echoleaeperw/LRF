The following driver appears impatient with current traffic conditions, compressing time headway to a dangerous 0.5 seconds, actual distance between vehicles only about 4 meters. Regardless of how traffic flow changes, regardless of how ego vehicle adjusts speed, this red sedan sticks like glue to the rear bumper.

This is a typical two-way, two-lane road with good surface conditions and clear center yellow line. Ego vehicle (blue Toyota Corolla) travels smoothly at 55 km/h in right lane, driver enjoying peaceful rural driving. However, this tranquility is soon broken: a heavily loaded large truck appears in the oncoming lane, massive body, deep engine sound. Initially, the truck travels normally in its own lane, but soon worrying signs appear. The truck begins showing obvious lateral instability—first its right wheels slightly cross the center yellow line, then entire vehicle body begins tilting toward the oncoming lane in a slow but continuous manner. This trajectory deviation behavior continues, truck increasingly invades ego vehicle's lane, forming a progressively intensifying head-on conflict threat."

However, this order is soon disrupted: a silver sports car appears in rearview mirror, its driver clearly dissatisfied with current traffic pace. This vehicle weaves through traffic at up to 80 km/h, completely ignoring road speed limit signs and surrounding traffic environment. Current distance between vehicles about 30 meters, but with such massive speed differential, this distance shrinks at alarming rate.
